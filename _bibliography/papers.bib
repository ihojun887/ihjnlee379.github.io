  title={Effective reinforcement learning for highly distributed data through K-mean clustering},
  author={H. Lee},
  abstract={Many papers studied stock data using various methods. From the existing traditional method to artificial intelligence, stocks have been studied in various ways such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. Stock data is data with a lot of uncertainty, so we wondered whether stock data could learn more stable by clustering it together with data with similar characteristics. In this paper, stock data was preprocessed through k-mean clustering, and created DQNs corresponding to each cluster and learn separately. The number of clusters for k-mean clustering is determined by the elbow method and trained DQNs suggest the best action to take at any state. we used data extracted per minute from the KODEX 200 ETF as a learning target, and for an evaluation, we first compare the learned clustered DQNs with two policy that takes random action or buy throughout the whole step to check whether clustered DQNs is properly trained or not. And to check the effectiveness of clustering, we compare clustered DQNs with DQN without clustering. As a result, clustered DQNs perform better than buy-only policy and random policy, and while non-clustered DQN could not learn properly, in the case of clustered DQNs, it performed well.},
