I am currently a graduate student at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in South Korea. I am pursuing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Computer Vision.
As a member of the Vision Lab at GIST, I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. Hae-Gon Jeon, a renowned expert in computer vision and deep learning.
At GIST, I have been exposed to cutting-edge research and technology, and I am constantly challenged to push my boundaries and think creatively.
